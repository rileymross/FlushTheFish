<ul>Made numerous accounts, floating around different ones (but proven in numerous ways). Proof of him owning most spam accounts:<br>

 <br>(Disclaimer: This video contains prejudice and offensive comments towards certain groups of people such as Canadians and Gay people.)
 </ul>

<ul>So obsessed that he even puts clips of a call about Darius being fired from his job in the intro of his livestreams</ul>

<ul>level1online is literally used to logging in/out of fake accounts and fiving himself fake attention on YouTube that he hearts his own comments and responds to them. Numerous examples:
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/VQlt6M">Hearting his own comment on a fake Darius truxton account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/SMMv4">That, as well as doxxing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7K_jOecRg-_xLhDHg02jPg">The Flat Earth Video Gamer</a> and insulting his own family.</a></li>

  </ul>

<ul>Tried to make Albert Menendez look like he has a criminal record and claimed he was homeless (made fun of him for it as well)</ul>
<ul>Made a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riley.ross8/">fake instagram account of me</a> with explicit imgery and contacted my family and their friends with it.</ul>

<ul>Tried to call Darius Truxton a pedophile numerous times with his only "evidence" being that 8-Bit Eric claimed it so, and the whole reason he accused Darius of that was because Darius accused him of having child pornography first. So it was possibly Eric trying to hide the fact that he may have had child pornography on his computer. Not proven, but I believe possible.</ul>
<p>level1online has made countless accusations and stories about Darius truxton and other YouTubers. A list of them can be found <a href="https://level1online.neocities.org/metoo.html">on this page. This page comes from a joke website I made, but the information is still there.</a>:</p>

(Coming Soon)</p>
<p>UPDATE! (11/11/22) level1online is aware of this campaign and has now openly threatened to try and harass my parents:<br>
<iframe width="290" height="358" src="https://player.thetavideoapi.com/video/video_eb4jb4mr80xn0ednnf7r3gvw1m" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<ul><p>We have information on the main perpetrator behind all this activity, not knowing from doxxing but from information he has mostly shared openly that I know from friends of mine who were also harassed by him.</p>
<p>His name is Jason Santiago and he lives in Florida. He is in his 40s and one person who claims to know him told us that his town's local police department knows him by name. I believe that this person is mentally deranged. I think one possible reason is that he was formerly an employee for a company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognizant#Working_conditions_and_mental_health_issues">Cognizant (which was doing work for Facebook)</a> that treated their staff very poorly and caused a lot of them to leave the company mentally damaged due to poor working conditions as well as being exposed to graphic imagery every day:<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bDnjiNCtFk4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This happened around 2019, which was right around the time level1online started obsessing over all these YouTubers and becoming an internet troll. In the past, he's claimed that he used to work for Facebook as well as worked a job that matched the description of the Cognizant position. So I think this may have been what started it, not that it excuses any of his behavior.
</p></ul>
<ul>This is not some sort of personal revenge campaign like kiwifarms or something. it is simply me and my friends wanting to live our lives. We are not asking for any money; only exposure. This whole thing happened because dishonest and cowardly people are conflicted when they see real, hardworking people like myself, Darius Truxton, AfroGamerDude, Albert Menendez, etc.. They're always barely flipping in their bowls, almost ready to be put out of their misery. It's time to set a better precedent for social media. It's time to finally #FlushTheFish.</ul>
