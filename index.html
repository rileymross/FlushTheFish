<p>My name is Riley Ross. I have become the target of harassment from someone on the internet who goes by level1online, A.K.A. Jason Santiago. He has made a fake instagram account of me with sexually explicit images posted on it, tried to scare and contact my parents, doxxed an address associated with my family, and has shown no intention of stopping. He has a history of doing this, particularly based on an obsession with another YouTuber called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd5Y3Qoqwt5Rny_6djYe-Kg/">Darius Truxton</a>.<br> I would like to show you the <i>mountains</i> of proof that level1online has been doing this to myelf and numerous others, and <i>also</i> to expose numerous popular YouTubers who have been supporting him openly.<br> I want help on forcing him to stop, ideally finding a way to threaten legal action against him and the others who have supproted him. He has a clear and proven obsession with getting attention, particularly on YouTube, and he and many others support doxxing and predatory activity. level1online has become like a hired troll for some YouTubers suchs as 8-Bit Eric and Radical Reggie, so that they can get somebody else to attack and harass anyone out there who criticize the names of their large channels without taking the blame for it themselves
<br>Both Radical Reggie and 8-Bit Eric have blocked me and my friends on social media <i>simply</i> for the fact that we stood up against these people and exposed what they were doing. Currently, 8-Bit Eric and OverThink Gaming let level1online moderate on their channels, and Radical Reggie livestreams with him regularly. One other YouTuber with a significant following who has supported this troll openly is Smash JT. He has tuned into livestreams that were dedicated to doxxing and harassing other people, and then even tried to pin the blame onto Darius Truxton when finally confronted about this.</p>

 <br>(Disclaimer: This video contains prejudice and offensive comments towards certain groups of people such as Canadians and Gay people.)
 </ul>
</p>
<ul>So obsessed that he even puts clips of a call about Darius being fired from his job in the intro of his livestreams</ul>

<ul>level1online is literally used to logging in/out of fake accounts and fiving himself fake attention on YouTube that he hearts his own comments and responds to them. Numerous examples:
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/VQlt6M">Hearting his own comment on a fake Darius truxton account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/SMMv4">That, as well as doxxing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7K_jOecRg-_xLhDHg02jPg">The Flat Earth Video Gamer</a> and insulting his own family.</a></li>

<li><a href="https://archive.ph/0fGEl">All fake accounts, a lot of them joking about sexual harassment of Darius Truxton's sister, multiple about harassing his job life.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.ph/MYNmS">One of his <i>many</i> fake accounts.</li>
  </ul>

<ul>Tried to make Albert Menendez look like he has a criminal record and claimed he was homeless (made fun of him for it as well)</ul>
<ul>Made a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riley.ross8/">fake instagram account of me</a> with explicit imgery and contacted my family and their friends with it.</ul>

<ul>Tried to call Darius Truxton a pedophile numerous times with his only "evidence" being that 8-Bit Eric claimed it so, and the whole reason he accused Darius of that was because Darius accused him of having child pornography first. So it was possibly Eric trying to hide the fact that he may have had child pornography on his computer. Not proven, but I believe possible.</ul>
<p>level1online has made countless accusations and stories about Darius truxton and other YouTubers. A list of them can be found <a href="https://level1online.neocities.org/metoo.html">on this page. This page comes from a joke website I made, but the information is still there.</a>:</p>

<p>The reason Darius Truxton coined the term "Flush the Fish" is because we started calling his "Fish lips" due to his big fish-lips. Although nobody would have started insulting him back if it weren't for all his antics that I've described above! Someone needs to stop this kid. He has gone insane, and there's been a lot of evidence to suggest that he has no occupation or anything he does all day besides troll for hours a day. Put him out of his misery!</p>
<p>They are obsessed with taking videos down through abusing the system, and youtube hardly ever repsonds to appeals or listens when we try to report it. <a href="https://twitter.com/FadFilth/status/1580340825120047105">They just have bots respond on their twitter support account</a>.
But this video will be posted on its own website and be uploaded multiple places:
(Coming Soon)</p>
<p>UPDATE! (11/11/22) level1online is aware of this campaign and has now openly threatened to try and harass my parents:<br>
<iframe width="280" height="358" src="https://player.thetavideoapi.com/video/video_eb4jb4mr80xn0ednnf7r3gvw1m" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<ul><p>We have information on the main perpetrator behind all this activity, not knowing from doxxing but from information he has mostly shared openly that I know from friends of mine who were also harassed by him.</p>
<p>His name is Jason Santiago and he lives in Florida. He is in his 40s and one person who claims to know him told us that his town's local police department knows him by name. I believe that this person is mentally deranged. I think one possible reason is that he was formerly an employee for a company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognizant#Working_conditions_and_mental_health_issues">Cognizant (which was doing work for Facebook)</a> that treated their staff very poorly and caused a lot of them to leave the company mentally damaged due to poor working conditions as well as being exposed to graphic imagery every day:<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bDnjiNCtFk4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This happened around 2019, which was right around the time level1online started obsessing over all these YouTubers and becoming an internet troll. In the past, he's claimed that he used to work for Facebook as well as worked a job that matched the description of the Cognizant position. So I think this may have been what started it, not that it excuses any of his behavior.
</p></ul>
<ul>This is not some sort of personal revenge campaign like kiwifarms or something. it is simply me and my friends wanting to live our lives. We are not asking for any money; only exposure. This whole thing happened because dishonest and cowardly people are conflicted when they see real, hardworking people like myself, Darius Truxton, AfroGamerDude, Albert Menendez, etc.. They're always barely flipping in their bowls, almost ready to be put out of their misery. It's time to set a better precedent for social media. It's time to finally #FlushTheFish.</ul>
