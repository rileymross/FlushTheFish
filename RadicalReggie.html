    <h1><u>Radical Reggie</u></h1>
<ul>Doxxed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoVw8-uhtVyu8yf38vuu01A">Chief Deebo</a> right on <a href="https://archive.ph/XUiE5">livestream openly with Radical Reggie</a>, Reggie laughed with him about it:<br>

In case he takes this video down, here is another link. Go to at minute 25:28. Also doxxes Canadian Gamer's name at 30:10 <br>

 <p>See that chat and from Chief Deebo's perspective. Also he exposes that Reggie steals gameplay footage without giving credit to original uploader or sharing revenue:<br>

<br>Apparently level1online had been harassing and trolling in Chief Deebo's livestreams for over a year before this happened, and that was why level1online was so triggered when Chief Deebo sent him a friend request on stream.
      </ul>
<ul>Reggie normally spends time on level1online's livestreams:

<a href="https://archive.ph/wp7wY">Another example</a>, "we are level1online" identifying himself clearly as a part of his channel:<br>

</ul>
<p>I forget if I have it on file, but he once said in one of level1online's livestreams that "getting someone fired is the ultimate humiliation" after responding and laughign with him about trying to get Darius Truxton fired from his job.</p>
<p>Radical Reggie even <i>insults MetalJesusRocks</i>, who he's supposed to be the best friend of, laughing with level1online about how MJR blocked him for spamming around. Reggie now openly supports trolling YouTube channels that he works with?<br><a href="https://archive.ph/5YqP1#50%">https://archive.ph/5YqP1#50%</a><br>
